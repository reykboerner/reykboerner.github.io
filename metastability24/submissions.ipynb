      "<p>In ecosystems, environmental changes as a result of natural and human processes can cause some key parameters to change with time. Depending on how fast such a parameter changes, a tipping event can occur. Existing works on rate-induced tipping, or R-tipping, provided mathematical insights into this phenomenon in low-dimensional systems from a local dynamical point of view, revealing, e.g., the existence of a critical rate for some specific initial condition above which tipping will occur. Motivated by the observation that ecosystems are dynamic, most likely transient, and constantly driven away from some equilibrium state, we develop a global phase-space approach to R-tipping. In particular, we introduce the notion of the probability of R-tipping defined for initial conditions in the phase space. Using real-world, complex high-dimensional mutualistic networks as a paradigm, we discover a scaling law between this probability and the rate of parameter change, and provide a geometric theory to explain the scaling. Our analysis elucidates the meaning of the critical rate and its dependence on initial conditions. The phase-space approach offers a comprehensive physical framework to understand R-tipping.\n",

      "<p><b>Maria Cameron</b>, University of Maryland, USA<br>with Maria Cameron<br><i>Tuesday, 14:00-14:40, Room 3.0</i></p>\n",
      "<p>Many processes in nature e.g. genetic switches, ecological systems, and nonlinear oscillators with periodic forcing can be modeled using stochastic differential equations (SDEs) with small noise. For gradient SDEs, the invariant probability measure and the most probable escape paths from the attractors can be expressed in terms of their potential functions. For nongradient SDEs, the counterpart of the potential function is the quasipotential, a key function in the large deviations theory (Freidlin and Wentzell, 1970s — 2010s). The quasipotential is a function defined on the phase space as the solution to a certain optimal control problem. It allows us to obtain asymptotic estimates for the invariant measure in the small noise limit, find the most probable escape paths, and facilitate the visualization of the stochastic dynamics. I will give an overview of the theory of the quasipotential and discuss two approaches to computing it in whole regions of the phase space. The first approach is based on a greedy algorithm for solving a certain optimal control problem on the mesh in the phase space. The second approach directly computes the Lagrangian manifold in the lifted space and then projects the quasipotential level sets to the phase space.</p>\n",

      "<h4>Long Transients as a Possible Mechanism of Regime Shifts and Metastable Dynamics in Ecosystems</h4>\n",
      "<p><b>Sergei Petrovskii</b>, School of Computing and Mathematical Sciences, University of Leicester<br><i>Tuesday, 14:40-15:20, Room 3.0</i></p>\n",
      "<p>Ecological systems often show abrupt, significant changes - regime shifts - in response to apparently small, gradual changes in environmental conditions. Moreover, sometimes a regime shift happens without any clear reasons at all. Growing empirical evidence eventually led to a mathematical concept of tipping points [1]. In particular, B-tipping links an abrupt change to a bifurcation, e.g. to a saddle-node bifurcation resulting in a disappearance of a stable steady state. A few different types of tipping mechanisms have been suggested such as N-tipping (transitions in a multi-well potential due to the effect of noise), R-tipping (transitions due to a high rate of change) and P-tipping (extreme sensitivity during certain phases of system’s dynamics, cf. [2]). In my talk, I will discuss an alternative, different mechanism that can result in metastable dynamics: long transients [3]. During long transient dynamics, the system can mimic a possible asymptotical regime (e.g., steady state, limit cycle, or chaos) over an indefinitely long yet finite period of time before undergoing a fast transition to a different regime. There is a variety of mathematical structures that can lead to long transient dynamics, such as ‘crawlbys’, ghost attractors, slow-fast timescales, etc. [3,4]. I will emphasize the relation between long transients and metastability and argue that such “LT-tipping” is a plausible alternative to other types of tipping, in particular as it does not necessarily require presumptions needed for other types of tipping to occur. \n",

      "<h4>Metastability and jump processes</h4>\n",
      "<p><b>Bartłomiej Dybiec</b>, Institute of Theoretical Physics, Jagiellonian University<br><i>Tuesday, 16:00-16:40, Room 3.0</i></p>\n",
      "<p>A particle immersed in a liquid constantly interacts with other particles. Due to the enormous number of collisions, these interactions cannot be described exactly. An effective approximate description is provided by noise. Noise is a stochastic process that is used to describe complicated or not fully known interactions. According to central limit theorems, the sum of many independent identically distributed random variables tends to the Gaussian distribution (if components are characterized by finite variance) or to the α-stable density (diverging variance of components). Consequently, the Lévy noise and its special case—the Gaussian white noise (GWN)—are frequently used in the description of noise driven systems in the out-of-equilibrium and equilibrium regimes, respectively. Both of them share numerous similarities, however they significantly and inherently differs. α-stable noises (with α<2) inevitably lead to occurence of long jumps. Increasing number of observations demonstrates a plethora of situations in which non-Gaussian heavy tailed fluctuations are recorded. This indicates the need to in clude heavy-tailed fluctuations in the description of dynamical systems especially in out-of-equilibrium realms. The possibility of anomalously long jumps, drastically changes the properties of stochastic dynamical systems compared to their Gaussian noise driven counterparts. It is the long jumps that lead to bimodal non-equilibrium stationary states in single-well, super-harmonic, potential wells. Exploration of different scenarios for restricting or eliminating long jumps, allows for a better understanding of how long jumps determine the properties of stationary states and how they affect their modality. This provides a deeper understanding of the role of non-Gaussian long jumps and the mechanisms responsible for emergence of multimodal stationary states. [1] P. Pogorzelec and B. Dybiec, Resetting induced multimodality, Chaos 33, 063105 (2023). [2] P. Pogorzelec and B. Dybiec, Role of long jumps in Lévy noise-induced multimodality, Chaos 34, 063136 (2024)</p>\n",

We could use traps to understand how the insect's behaviours change. The most common traps that affect the insect's behaviour is a baited trap because the movement pattern changes from Correlate Random Walk to Bias Random Walk (BRWs). This, in turn, shows how the insect's behaviour changes. In this paper, we suppose the insect's behaviour changes in the step size and turning angle. That is four different behaviours in turning angle and five in step size.</p>\n",

      "<p>In this study, we employ a reduced-complexity ice age model by Talento & Ganopolski (2021), extended with stochastic additive noise, to produce an ensemble of alternative global mean ice volume trajectories over the last 800,000 years. The spread of the stochastic trajectories varies greatly throughout the simulation, allowing for the identification of roughly three regimes: 1) all trajectories approximately follow the same path, 2) trajectories gradually spread out, and 3) only a few possible paths are accessible. We attempt to apply the spectral gap of the transfer operator, computed using Ulam’s method in a sliding time window, as an indicator of global stability, hoping that a large spectral gap would identify periods of stability where all trajectories roughly follow the same path. In reality, it turns out to be more complicated, and a meaningful approach is yet to be discovered. Challenges include the model being nonautonomous (due to orbital forcing) and non-Markovian (due to an ice-volume integrating memory term), which breaks the semi-group property of the transfer operator, preventing a reliable approximation of the spectral gap, as well as selecting appropriate values for the transition time lag and length of the sliding window.</p>\n",

      "<p>Many potential tipping elements in the climate system have been identified over the past decade, but there are large uncertainties regarding their timing and spatial extent. Some tipping points might express themselves as abrupt shifts, with potentially drastic consequences on the climate system, dependent ecosystems, and society. This study presents an updated analysis of the likelihood of these abrupt shifts in the latest generation of climate models (CMIP6). We analyze 59 CMIP6 models under a scenario of a yearly 1% increase in CO2, using a Canny edge detection method - adapted for spatiotemporal dimensions - to detect abrupt shifts occurring on time scales from years to decades. Our semi-automatic analysis covers 83 variables across the ocean, atmosphere, and land. Using connected component analysis, we quantify the spatial extent of abrupt shifts. We focus our analysis on the following systems: North Atlantic subpolar gyre, Tibetan plateau, land permafrost, Amazon rainforest, Antarctic Sea Ice, monsoon systems, Arctic Summer Sea Ice, Arctic Winter Sea Ice, and Barents Sea Ice. For these systems, we study the number of detected abrupt shifts, their surface area, and at which global mean temperature they occur. We find evidence of abrupt shifts in most systems, but not all models show them equally.</p>\n",

      "<p><b>Jonathan Wong</b>, IBM Research Europe</p>\n",
      "<p>The cosmological model of the Universe, and the corresponding spacetime metric that characterises the gravitational field, are of fundamental significance to theoretical physics and astronomy. This framework represents a complex physical system in which particular unique solutions can either give rise to extreme observational phenomena, such as Einstein rings of galaxies, or could indicate a critical instability point in the underlying theory, such as the singularity of a black hole. In order to investigate such distinct properties of the gravitational field one can explore the optical scalars, a set of functions that measure the expansion, shear and rotational twist of a test circle as it propagates along a light path. This behaviour is characterised by the Sachs equations (Sachs 1961), a set of coupled differential equations in each scalar quantity that describe their overall evolution. In this study we explore and search for extreme transitional behaviour in solutions of the optical scalar equations that arise from a range of underlying cosmological models. We investigate in particular anisotropic Bianchi Type I cosmologies, and predict the effect that such extreme solutions will place on astrophysical signals, such as the (weak) gravitational lensing of galaxies by the large scale structure of the Universe.</p>\n",

      "<p>In collective migration problems, such as establishment of invasive species and disease spread, an understanding whether an invasion can and will be successful is vitally important. Realistic models of spatial invasion, typically formulated as partial differential equations with travelling wave solutions, thus often encompass transitions between successful invasion and extinction. Such transitions are usually under different parameter regimes which are not known a priori. In this work, we seek to demonstrate that these transitions can be detected using a variational approach. Using a reaction-diffusion equation with Allee (cubic) reaction kinetics and simple diffusion as a prototype model of collective invasion in one dimension, we detect a parameter-induced transition between solutions describing invasion and extinction. We further apply the variational approach to extensions of this reaction-diffusion equation with variable diffusion coefficient, and in two dimensions to characterise the conditions under which the solution behaviour changes in this framework. We link these conditions to previous characterisations. Overall, our work links traditional analysis of reaction-diffusion equations with a new approach for detecting parameter-induced transitions in solution behaviour.</p>\n",

      "<p>Epilepsy is a neurological disorder characterised by frequent seizures which can be depicted as metastable excited states. Epileptic spike-wave seizures are pronounced as abnormal cadence discharging of electrical activity within the brain. This cadence is an indication of underlying deterministic nonlinear oscillation. The early termination of spike-wave seizures can be achieved through single-pulse stimulus perturbations; however, this is not always successful. The dynamic transition between the background activity and epileptic seizure states is not fully understood. Questioning the system exhaustively can be difficult as it’s influenced by several factors. Recent work has shown that the markers of dynamical transitions in nonlinear dynamical systems can be explored through the functional derivatives of the equation residual. Using a neural population model to represent the epileptic spike waves within the thalamo-cortical coupling we structure the background activity basin of attraction as a four-dimensional object. We aim to find markers of dynamical transitions that solely depend on the form of the governing equation. Results from this work can lead to a better understanding of the success rate of stimuli responses to patient specific seizures simulations, further translating to the administration of high success rate stimulus to moderate real seizures.</p>\n",

      "<p><b>Navonil Neogi</b>, IBM Research Europe</p>\n",
      "<p>Fluid equations constitute prototypical examples of complex systems. Simple models of fluids exhibit tipping points between regimes of smooth solutions and ‘blow-ups’, or singularities, within finite time. Establishing the existence of these and constructing examples is fundamental to the field. Recent work has established such ‘blow-up’ solutions robustly for the first time in the case of the 3D Euler equation—a well-studied nonlinear PDE that models inviscid flow—with a cylindrical boundary. These solutions are self-similar, preserving an initial spatial profile propagated through time, and were found using an AI surrogate in the form of a physics-informed neural network (PINN) encoding the symmetries of the problem. Our research aims to explore this dynamical system using a variational approach, on the parameter space of self-similar solutions (controlled by an exponent). We aim to detect transitions in this approach between blow-up and non-blow-up solutions from the exponent parameter. We also aim to apply this approach to further fluid models, also studied using PINN solvers, that are known to exhibit blow-up behaviour. The results would be important for greater theoretical understanding of how and where blow-ups occur, and their sensitivity to parameters.</p>\n",

      "<p>The CMIP6 project revealed that some of the latest generation of climate models show a very strong response to increased concentrations of atmospheric CO2, as quantified by equilibrium climate sensitivity (ECS). This high sensitivity has implications for the carbon cycle. For example, at higher climate sensitivities, a small CO2 perturbation leads to larger warming, which in turn causes increased decomposition of organic matter. This increased decomposition tends to increase atmospheric CO2, leading to a positive feedback loop. Over the last 10,000 years or so (the Holocene epoch), atmospheric CO2 concentrations have remained approximately constant, at least until the anthropogenic perturbation from the industrial revolution. This means that the feedback loop cannot be too strong, placing bounds on equilibrium climate sensitivity. CMIP6 climate models, however, cut this feedback loop out by running with prescribed levels of CO2. We investigate using models of varying complexity, performing a bifurcation analysis to determine the climate sensitivies incompatible with the stable Holocene carbon cycle.</p>\n",

      "<p>Although machine learning methods have demonstrated their ability to capture dynamics from time series data, the prediction of sudden transitions, such as tipping points, remains a significant challenge. Since tipping of large-scale systems could onset impacting changes and presents a significant risk for human welfare, understanding the mechanisms behind tipping points is essential. In our research we use machine learning methods to obtain mathematical model descriptions from data, also known as symbolic regression. These equations would allow exploration of a wide range of possible outcomes and could aid in anticipating and possibly preventing sudden shifts or even collapse in a system. Although in recent years different symbolic regression algorithms have been successful in obtaining accurate model descriptions, it has not been applied as a tool to understand systems exhibiting tipping behaviour. Our research aims at developing symbolic regression algorithms such that they can be applied to systems undergoing bifurcations due to changing environmental parameters and external forces.</p>\n",

High-resolution imaging reveals that the cell’s actin cortex formation is preceded by a stage where thousands of highly branched actin structures transiently grow and disassemble. Some structures grow orders of magnitude past their intrinsic degradation time, yet without proliferating. We uncover how an overlooked bifurcation in the underlying biochemical dynamics can account for the huge lifetime disparity.  We show how a simple mechanism based on resource competition can explain how this process spontaneously self-tunes to the vicinity of this dynamical bifurcation.</p>\n",

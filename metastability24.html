                    3-5 September 2024</h3>

                <h4>Organisers</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Valerio Lucarini, University of Leicester</li>
                        <li>Reyk BÃ¶rner, University of Reading</li>
                        <li>Peter Ashwin, University of Exeter</li>
                        <li>Larissa Serdukova, University of Leicester</li>
                    </ul>
                
                <p>The goal of the conference is to share recent results in mathematics and its applications to science and engineering of the theory of metastability for complex systems. There are different definitions of metastability, which try to account for the complex phenomenology behind it. While classically metastability emerges as a result of adding noise to dynamical systems exhibiting multistability (i.e. featuring multiple competing attractors), long transient behaviour has more recently been associated with some metastable behaviour and has provided a convincing mathematical description of the ongoing processes. The conference aims at bringing together experts in the area in order to facilitate discussion between different viewpoints on the problem and to foster interaction between pure mathematical research and applications in areas like climate, ecology, power systems, data science, and material science.</p>

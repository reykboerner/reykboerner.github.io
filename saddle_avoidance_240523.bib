	abstract = {The Earth is well known to be, in the current astronomical configuration, in a regime where two asymptotic states can be realized. The warm state we live in is in competition with the ice-covered snowball state. The bistability exists as a result of the positive ice-albedo feedback. In a previous investigation performed on a intermediate complexity climate model we identified the unstable climate states (melancholia states) separating the coexisting climates, and studied their dynamical and geometrical properties. The melancholia states are ice covered up to the midlatitudes and attract trajectories initialized on the basin boundary. In this Letter, we study how stochastically perturbing the parameter controlling the intensity of the incoming solar radiation impacts the stability of the climate. We detect transitions between the warm and the snowball state and analyze in detail the properties of the noise-induced escapes from the corresponding basins of attraction. We determine the most probable paths for the transitions and find evidence that the melancholia states act as gateways, similarly to saddle points in an energy landscape.},

It is shown that multistable systems are very sensitive to perturbations leading to a noise-induced hopping process between attractors. The role of chaotic saddles in the escape from attractors in multistable systems is discussed.},

	abstract = {The theory of large deviations is concerned with the exponential decay of probabilities of large fluctuations in random systems. These probabilities are important in many fields of study, including statistics, finance, and engineering, as they often yield valuable information about the large fluctuations of a random system around its most probable state or trajectory. In the context of equilibrium statistical mechanics, the theory of large deviations provides exponential-order estimates of probabilities that refine and generalize Einstein’s theory of fluctuations. This review explores this and other connections between large deviation theory and statistical mechanics, in an effort to show that the mathematical language of statistical mechanics is the language of large deviation theory. The first part of the review presents the basics of large deviation theory, and works out many of its classical applications related to sums of random variables and Markov processes. The second part goes through many problems and results of statistical mechanics, and shows how these can be formulated and derived within the context of large deviation theory. The problems and results treated cover a wide range of physical systems, including equilibrium many-particle systems, noise-perturbed dynamics, nonequilibrium systems, as well as multifractals, disordered systems, and chaotic systems. This review also covers many fundamental aspects of statistical mechanics, such as the derivation of variational principles characterizing equilibrium and nonequilibrium states, the breaking of the Legendre transform for nonconcave entropies, and the characterization of nonequilibrium fluctuations through fluctuation relations.},

First, drawing from the theory of quasi-potentials, and viewing the state space as an energy landscape with valleys and mountain ridges, we infer the relative likelihood of the identified multistable climate states and investigate the most likely transition trajectories as well as the expected transition times between them. Second, harnessing techniques from data science, and specifically manifold learning, we characterize the data landscape of the simulation output to find climate states and basin boundaries within a fully agnostic and unsupervised framework. Both approaches show remarkable agreement, and reveal, apart from the well known warm and snowball earth states, a third intermediate stable state in one of the two versions of PLASIM, the climate model used in this study. The combination of our approaches allows to identify how the negative feedback of ocean heat transport and entropy production via the hydrological cycle drastically change the topography of the dynamical landscape of Earth’s climate.},

The SPDE may be viewed as an infinite-dimensional analogue of the Langevin equation used in finite-dimensional sampling. In this paper, conditioned nonlinear SDEs, leading to nonlinear SPDEs for the sampling, are studied. In addition, a class of preconditioned SPDEs is studied, found by applying a Green’s operator to the SPDE in such a way that the invariant measure remains unchanged; such infinite dimensional evolution equations are important for the development of practical algorithms for sampling infinite dimensional problems. The resulting SPDEs provide several significant challenges in the theory of SPDEs. The two primary ones are the presence of nonlinear boundary conditions, involving first order derivatives, and a loss of the smoothing property in the case of the pre-conditioned SPDEs. These challenges are overcome and a theory of existence, uniqueness and ergodicity is developed in sufficient generality to subsume the sampling problems of interest to us. The Gaussian theory developed in Part I of this paper considers Gaussian SDEs, leading to linear Gaussian SPDEs for sampling. This Gaussian theory is used as the basis for deriving nonlinear SPDEs which affect the desired sampling in the nonlinear case, via a change of measure.},

	abstract = {Freidlin-Wentzell theory of large deviations for the description of the effect of small random perturbations on dynamical systems is exploited as a numerical tool. Specifically, a numerical algorithm is proposed to compute the quasi-potential in the theory, which is the key object to quantify the dynamics on long time scales when the effect of the noise becomes ubiquitous: the equilibrium distribution of the system, the pathways of transition between metastable states and their rate, etc., can all be expressed in terms of the quasi-potential. We propose an algorithm to compute these quantities called the geometric minimum action method (gMAM), which is a blend of the original minimum action method (MAM) and the string method. It is based on a reformulation of the large deviations action functional on the space of curves that allows one to easily perform the double minimization of the original action required to compute the quasi-potential. The theoretical background of the gMAM in the context of large deviations theory is discussed in detail, as well as the algorithmic aspects of the method. The gMAM is then illustrated on several examples: a finite-dimensional system displaying bistability and modeled by a nongradient stochastic ordinary differential equation, an infinite-dimensional analogue of this system modeled by a stochastic partial differential equation, and an example of a bistable genetic switch modeled by a Markov jump process. © 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

We study transition paths for thermally activated molecules governed by the Langevin equation in the overdamped limit of Brownian dynamics. Using gradient descent in pathspace, we minimize the Onsager–Machlup functional for a range of model problems in one and two dimensions and then for some simple atomic models including Lennard-Jones seven-atom and 38-atom clusters, as well as for a model of vacancy diffusion in a planar crystal. Our results demonstrate interesting effects, which can occur at nonzero temperature, showing transition paths that could not be predicted on the basis of the zero temperature limit. However the results also demonstrate unphysical features associated with such Onsager–Machlup minimizers. As there is a growing literature that addresses transition path sampling by related techniques, these insights add a potentially useful perspective into the interpretation of this body of work.},

It can be found in different areas of science, such as physics, chemistry, biology, economy, and in nature. The final state of a multistable system depends crucially on the initial conditions. From the viewpoint of applications, there are two major issues related to the emergence of multistability. On one hand, this phenomenon often can create inconvenience, as for instance, in the design of a commercial device with specific characteristics, where multistability needs to be avoided or the desired state has to be stabilized against a noisy environment, and on the other hand, the coexistence of different stable states offers a great flexibility in the system performance without major parameter changes, that can be used with the right control strategies to induce a definite switching between different coexisting states. These two examples alone illustrate the importance of multistability control in applied nonlinear science. For the last decade a lot of research has been devoted to the development of control techniques of multistable systems. These methods cover several strategies, going from feedback control methods to nonfeedback, such as periodic or stochastic perturbations capable of changing the coexisting states stability and driving the system from multistability to monostability. We review the most representative control strategies, discuss their theoretical background and experimental realization.},

This work is devoted to the study of the quasipotential of nongradient SDEs with isotropic diffusion. The goals are: (i) to understand the theoretical behavior of the quasipotential, and (ii) to develop tools for its numerical study. This work is focused on 2D equations with asymptotically stable equilibria and limit cycles. In the theoretical part, we establish a number of properties of the quasipotential. For 2D linear equations, we derive an exact formula for the quasipotential. For 2D nonlinear equations, we establish how the quasipotential grows near the stable equilibria and the stable limit cycles. In the numerical part of this work we adjust the OUM for computing the quasipotential on a regular mesh. We show that the quasipotential satisfies a Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman equation with an anisotropic and unbounded speed function. The unbounded speed function may lead to an additional consistency error in specific areas of the phase space. However, we conduct an error analysis and show that even if this error appears, it decays quadratically as we refine the mesh. We apply the proposed numerical algorithm to a number of examples: linear systems, the Maier–Stein model, a system with stochastic resonance, and a system with two stable limit cycles. Whenever it is appropriate, we compute the Minimum Action Paths by shooting characteristics. The Minimum Action Paths found in this way are necessarily the global minimizers of the Freidlin–Wentzell action.},

	abstract = {The developmental dynamics of multicellular organisms is a process that takes place in a multi-stable system in which each attractor state represents a cell type, and attractor transitions correspond to cell differentiation paths. This new understanding has revived the idea of a quasi-potential landscape, first proposed by Waddington as a metaphor. To describe development, one is interested in the ‘relative stabilities’ of N attractors (N {\textgreater} 2). Existing theories of state transition between local minima on some potential landscape deal with the exit part in the transition between two attractors in pair-attractor systems but do not offer the notion of a global potential function that relates more than two attractors to each other. Several ad hoc methods have been used in systems biology to compute a landscape in non-gradient systems, such as gene regulatory networks. Here we present an overview of currently available methods, discuss their limitations and propose a new decomposition of vector fields that permits the computation of a quasi-potential function that is equivalent to the Freidlin–Wentzell potential but is not limited to two attractors. Several examples of decomposition are given, and the significance of such a quasi-potential function is discussed.},

Through numerical simulations, we explore the noise-induced transitions between the competing warm and snowball climate states. We consider multiplicative stochastic forcing driven by Gaussian and \&alpha;-stable L\&eacute;vy \&ndash; \&alpha; \&isin; (0, 2) \&ndash; noise laws, and examine the statistics of transition times and most probable transition paths. While the Gaussian noise case \&ndash; used here as a reference \&ndash; has been extensively studied in a plethora of studies on metastable systems, much less is known about the L\&eacute;vy case, both in terms of mathematical theory and heuristics, especially in the case of high- and infinite-dimensional systems. In the weak noise limit, the expected residence time in each metastable state scales in a fundamentally different way in the Gaussian vs. L\&eacute;vy noise case with respect to the intensity of the noise. In the former case, the classical Kramers-like exponential law is recovered. In the latter case, power laws are found, with the exponent equal to \&minus;\&alpha;, in apparent agreement with rigorous results obtained for additive noise in a related \&ndash; yet different \&ndash; reaction-diffusion equation as well as in simpler models. The transition paths are studied in a projection of the state space and remarkable differences are observed between the two different types of noise. The snowball-to-warm and the warm-to-snowball most probable transition path cross at the single unstable edge state on the basin boundary. In the case of L\&eacute;vy noise, the most probable transition paths in the two directions are wholly separated, as transitions apparently take place via the closest basin boundary region to the outgoing attractor.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Nongradient stochastic differential equations (SDEs) with position-dependent and anisotropic diffusion are often used in biological modeling. The quasi-potential is a crucial function in the Large Deviation Theory that allows one to estimate transition rates between attractors of the corresponding ordinary differential equation and find the maximum likelihood transition paths. Unfortunately, the quasi-potential can rarely be found analytically. It is defined as the solution to a certain action minimization problem. In this work, the recently introduced Ordered Line Integral Method (OLIM) is extended for computing the quasi-potential for 2D SDEs with anisotropic and position-dependent diffusion scaled by a small parameter on a regular rectangular mesh. The presented solver employs the dynamical programming principle. At each step, a local action minimization problem is solved using straight line path segments and the midpoint quadrature rule. The solver is tested on two examples where analytic formulas for the quasi-potential are available. The dependence of the computational error on the mesh size, the update factor K (a key parameter of OLIMs), as well as the degree and the orientation of anisotropy is established. The effect of anisotropy on the quasi-potential and the maximum likelihood paths is demonstrated on the Maier–Stein model. The proposed solver is applied to find the quasi-potential and the maximum likelihood transition paths in a model of the genetic switch in Lambda Phage between the lysogenic state where the phage reproduces inside the infected cell without killing it, and the lytic state where the phage destroys the infected cell.},

	abstract = {For diffusive stochastic dynamics, the probability to observe any individual trajectory is vanishingly small, making it unclear how to experimentally validate theoretical results for ratios of path probabilities. We provide the missing link between theory and experiment by establishing a protocol to extract ratios of path probabilities from measured time series. For experiments on a single colloidal particle in a microchannel, we extract both ratios of path probabilities and the most probable path for a barrier crossing, and find excellent agreement with independently calculated predictions based on the Onsager-Machlup stochastic action. Our experimental results at room temperature are found to be inconsistent with the low-noise Freidlin-Wentzell stochastic action, and we discuss under which circumstances the latter action is expected to describe the most probable path. Furthermore, while the experimentally accessible ratio of path probabilities is uniquely determined, the formal path-integral action is known to depend on the time-discretization scheme used for deriving it; we reconcile these two seemingly contradictory facts by careful analysis of the time-slicing derivation of the path integral. Our experimental protocol enables us to probe probability distributions on path space and allows us to relate theoretical single-trajectory results to measurement., This article appears in the following collection:},

	abstract = {Bifurcations can cause dynamical systems with slowly varying parameters to transition to far-away attractors. The terms “critical transition” or “tipping point” have been used to describe this situation. Critical transitions have been observed in an astonishingly diverse set of applications from ecosystems and climate change to medicine and finance. The main goal of this paper is to give an overview which standard mathematical theories can be applied to critical transitions. We shall focus on early-warning signs that have been suggested to predict critical transitions and point out what mathematical theory can provide in this context. Starting from classical bifurcation theory and incorporating multiple time scale dynamics one can give a detailed analysis of local bifurcations that induce critical transitions. We suggest that the mathematical theory of fast–slow systems provides a natural definition of critical transitions. Since noise often plays a crucial role near critical transitions the next step is to consider stochastic fast–slow systems. The interplay between sample path techniques, partial differential equations and random dynamical systems is highlighted. Each viewpoint provides potential early-warning signs for critical transitions. Since increasing variance has been suggested as an early-warning sign we examine it in the context of normal forms analytically, numerically and geometrically; we also consider autocorrelation numerically. Hence we demonstrate the applicability of early-warning signs for generic models. We end with suggestions for future directions of the theory.},

In addition, we develop a general conceptual framework to compare and contrast the different results by proposing a three-step process. First, one specifies the setting and restrictions of the differential equation problem to be studied and identifies the relevant small parameters. Second, one defines a notion of equivalence via a property/observable for partitioning the parameter space into suitable regions near the singular limit. Third, one studies the possible asymptotic singular limit problems as well as perturbation results to complete the diagrammatic subdivision process. We illustrate this approach for two simple problems from algebra and analysis. Then we proceed to the review of several modern double-limit problems including multiple time scales, stochastic dynamics, spatial patterns, and network coupling. For each example, we illustrate the previously mentioned three-step process and show that already double-limit parametric diagrams provide an excellent unifying theme. After this review, we compare and contrast the common features among the different examples. We conclude with a brief outlook, how our methodology can help to systematize the field better, and how it can be transferred to a wide variety of other classes of differential equations.},

	abstract = {A stochastic model of climate variability is considered in which slow changes of climate are explained as the integral response to continuous random excitation by short period “weather” isturbances. The coupled ocean-atmosphere-cryosphere-land system is divided into a rapidly varying “weather” system (essentially the atmosphere) and a slowly responding “climate” system (the ocean, cryosphere, land vegetation, etc.). In the usual Statistical Dynamical Model (SDM) only the average transport effects of the rapidly varying weather components are parameterised in the climate system. The resultant prognostic equations are deterministic, and climate variability can normally arise only through variable external conditions. The essential feature of stochastic climate models is that the non-averaged “weather” components are also retained. They appear formally as random forcing terms. The climate system, acting as an integrator of this short-period excitation, exhibits the same random-walk response characteristics as large particles interacting with an ensemble of much smaller particles in the analogous Brownian motion problem. The model predicts “red” variance spectra, in qualitative agreement with observations. The evolution of the climate probability distribution is described by a Fokker-Planck equation, in which the effect of the random weather excitation is represented by diffusion terms. Without stabilising feedback, the model predicts a continuous increase in climate variability, in analogy with the continuous, unbounded dispersion of particles in Brownian motion (or in a homogeneous turbulent fluid). Stabilising feedback yields a statistically stationary climate probability distribution. Feedback also results in a finite degree of climate predictability, but for a stationary climate the predictability is limited to maximal skill parameters of order 0.5.},

It has recently become apparent that large deviation theory (LDT) is very useful for investigating persistent extreme events, and specifically, for flexibly estimating long return periods and for introducing a notion of dynamical typicality. Using a methodological framework based on LDT and taking advantage of long simulations by a state-of-the-art Earth system model, we investigate the 2021 Western North America summer heatwave. Indeed, our analysis shows that the 2021 event can be seen as an unlikely but possible manifestation of climate variability, whilst its probability of occurrence is greatly amplified by the ongoing climate change. We also clarify the properties of spatial coherence of the 2021 heatwave and elucidate the role played by the Rocky Mountains in modulating hot, dry, and persistent extreme events in the Western Pacific region of North America.},

By applying large deviation theory to a state-of-the-art Earth system model, we define the climatology of persistent heatwaves and cold spells in key target geographical regions by estimating the rate functions for the surface temperature, and we assess the impact of increasing CO2 concentration on such persistent anomalies. Hence, we can better quantify the increasing hazard due to heatwaves in a warmer climate. We show that two 2010 high impact events—summer Russian heatwave and winter Dzud in Mongolia—are associated with atmospheric patterns that are exceptional compared to the typical ones but typical compared to the climatology of extremes. Their dynamics is encoded in the natural variability of the climate. Finally, we propose and test an approximate formula for the return times of large and persistent temperature fluctuations from easily accessible statistical properties.},

	abstract = {Critical transitions in multistable systems have been discussed as models for a variety of phenomena ranging from the extinctions of species to socioeconomic changes and climate transitions between ice ages and warm ages. From bifurcation theory we can expect certain critical transitions to be preceded by a decreased recovery from external perturbations. The consequences of this critical slowing down have been observed as an increase in variance and autocorrelation prior to the transition. However, especially in the presence of noise, it is not clear whether these changes in observation variables are statistically relevant such that they could be used as indicators for critical transitions. In this contribution we investigate the predictability of critical transitions in conceptual models. We study the quadratic integrate-and-fire model and the van der Pol model under the influence of external noise. We focus especially on the statistical analysis of the success of predictions and the overall predictability of the system. The performance of different indicator variables turns out to be dependent on the specific model under study and the conditions of accessing it. Furthermore, we study the influence of the magnitude of transitions on the predictive performance.},

	abstract = {Motivated by the famous Waddington’s epigenetic landscape metaphor in developmental biology, biophysicists and applied mathematicians made different proposals to construct the landscape for multi-stable complex systems. We aim to summarize and elucidate the relationships among these theories from a mathematical point of view. We systematically investigate and compare three different but closely related realizations in the recent literature: the Wang’s potential landscape theory from steady state distribution of stochastic differential equations (SDEs), the Freidlin-Wentzell quasi-potential from the large deviation theory, and the construction through SDE decomposition and A-type integral. We revisit that the quasi-potential is the zero noise limit of the potential landscape, and the potential function in the third proposal coincides with the quasi-potential. We compare the difference between local and global quasi-potential through the viewpoint of exchange of limit order for time and noise amplitude. We argue that local quasi-potentials are responsible for getting transition rates between neighboring stable states, while the global quasi-potential mainly characterizes the residence time of the states as the system reaches stationarity. The difference between these two is prominent when the transitivity property is broken. The most probable transition path by minimizing the Onsager-Machlup or Freidlin-Wentzell action functional is also discussed. As a consequence of the established connections among different proposals, we arrive at the novel result which guarantees the existence of SDE decomposition while denies its uniqueness in general cases. It is, therefore, clarified that the A-type integral is more appropriate to be applied to the decomposed SDEs rather than its primitive form as believed by previous researchers. Our results contribute to a deeper understanding of landscape theories for biological systems.},

This BVP model serves as a simple representative of a class of excitable-oscillatory systems including the Hodgkin-Huxley (HH) model of the squid giant axon. The BVP phase plane can be divided into regions corresponding to the physiological states of nerve fiber (resting, active, refractory, enhanced, depressed, etc.) to form a "physiological state diagram," with the help of which many physiological phenomena can be summarized. A properly chosen projection from the 4-dimensional HH phase space onto a plane produces a similar diagram which shows the underlying relationship between the two models. Impulse trains occur in the BVP and HH models for a range of constant applied currents which make the singular point representing the resting state unstable.},

In addition, this line has a certain threshold value in respect to the signal height, and signals smaller than the threshold or noise are eliminated in the course of transmission.

It is also responsible for the sudden collapse of speculative bubbles. Interestingly, these crashes appear as rare, “activated” events, and have an exponentially small probability of occurence. The model leads to a speciﬁc “shape” of the falldown of the price during a crash, which we compare with the October 1987 data. The normal regime, where the stock price exhibits behavior similar to that of a random walk, however reveals non trivial correlations on diﬀerent time scales, in particular on the time scale over which operators perceive a change of trend.},

The warm climate is analogous to the present one; the snowball climate features global glaciation and conditions that can hardly support life forms. Paleoclimatic evidences suggest that in the past our planet flipped between these two states. The main physical mechanism responsible for such an instability is the ice-albedo feedback. In a previous work, we defined the Melancholia states that sit between the two climates. Such states are embedded in the boundaries between the two basins of attraction and feature extensive glaciation down to relatively low latitudes. Here, we explore the global stability properties of the system by introducing random perturbations as modulations to the intensity of the incoming solar radiation. We observe noise-induced transitions between the competing basins of attraction. In the weak-noise limit, large deviation laws define the invariant measure, the statistics of escape times, and typical escape paths called instantons. By constructing the instantons empirically, we show that the Melancholia states are the gateways for the noise-induced transitions. In the region of multistability, in the zero-noise limit, the measure is supported only on one of the competing attractors. For low (high) values of the solar irradiance, the limit measure is the snowball (warm) climate. The changeover between the two regimes corresponds to a first-order phase transition in the system. The framework we propose seems of general relevance for the study of complex multistable systems. Finally, we put forward a new method for constructing Melancholia states from direct numerical simulations, which provides a possible alternative with respect to the edge-tracking algorithm.},

Such rate-dependent tipping, or R-tipping, need not be associated with either bifurcations or noise.

	abstract = {Cortical neurons emit seemingly erratic trains of action potentials or “spikes,” and neural network dynamics emerge from the coordinated spiking activity within neural circuits. These rich dynamics manifest themselves in a variety of patterns, which emerge spontaneously or in response to incoming activity produced by sensory inputs. In this Review, we focus on neural dynamics that is best understood as a sequence of repeated activations of a number of discrete hidden states. These transiently occupied states are termed “metastable” and have been linked to important sensory and cognitive functions. In the rodent gustatory cortex, for instance, metastable dynamics have been associated with stimulus coding, with states of expectation, and with decision making. In frontal, parietal, and motor areas of macaques, metastable activity has been related to behavioral performance, choice behavior, task difficulty, and attention. In this article, we review the experimental evidence for neural metastable dynamics together with theoretical approaches to the study of metastable activity in neural circuits. These approaches include (i) a theoretical framework based on non-equilibrium statistical physics for network dynamics; (ii) statistical approaches to extract information about metastable states from a variety of neural signals; and (iii) recent neural network approaches, informed by experimental results, to model the emergence of metastable dynamics. By discussing these topics, we aim to provide a cohesive view of how transitions between different states of activity may provide the neural underpinnings for essential functions such as perception, memory, expectation, or decision making, and more generally, how the study of metastable neural activity may advance our understanding of neural circuit function in health and disease.},

	abstract = {In the small noise regime, the average transition time between metastable states of a reversible diffusion process is described at the logarithmic scale by Arrhenius’ law. The Eyring–Kramers formula classically provides a subexponential prefactor to this large deviation estimate. For irreversible diffusion processes, the equivalent of Arrhenius’ law is given by the Freidlin–Wentzell theory. In this paper, we compute the associated prefactor and thereby generalise the Eyring–Kramers formula to irreversible diffusion processes. In our formula, the role of the potential is played by Freidlin–Wentzell’s quasipotential, and a correction depending on the non-Gibbsianness of the system along the minimum action paths is highlighted. Our study assumes some properties for the vector field: (1) attractors are isolated points, (2) the dynamics restricted to basin of attraction boundaries are attracted to single points (which are saddle-points of the vector field). We moreover assume that the minimum action paths that connect attractors to adjacent saddle-points (the instantons) have generic properties that are summarised in the conclusion. At a technical level, our derivation combines an exact computation for the first-order WKB expansion around the instanton and an exact computation of the first-order match asymptotics expansion close to the saddle-point. While the results are exact once a formal expansion is assumed, the validity of these asymptotic expansions remains to be proven.},

For both autocatalytic and nonautocatalytic reactions, the analysis of the distribution about a stable stationary state and of the transitions between coexisting stable states comes, to logarithmic accuracy, to the analysis of Hamiltonian dynamics of an auxiliary dynamical system. The latter can be done explicitly in a few cases, including one‐species systems, systems with detailed balance, and systems close to the bifurcation points where the number of the stable states changes. In the last case, the fluctuations display universal features, and, for saddle‐node bifurcation points, the logarithm of the probability of escape from the metastable state (per unit time) is proportional to the distance to the bifurcation point (in the parameter space) raised to the power 3/2. We compare the eikonal approximation for the stationary distribution of a master equation to Monte Carlo numerical solutions for two chemical two‐variable systems with multiple stationary states, where none of the cited restrictions exists. For one of the systems in the pattern of optimal paths we observe caustics emanating from the saddle point.},

	abstract = {Specific components of the Earth system may abruptly change their state in response to gradual changes in forcing. This possibility has attracted great scientific interest in recent years, and has been recognized as one of the greatest threats associated with anthropogenic climate change. Examples of such components, called tipping elements, include the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation, the polar ice sheets, the Amazon rainforest, as well as the tropical monsoon systems. The mathematical language to describe abrupt climatic transitions is mainly based on the theory of nonlinear dynamical systems and, in particular, on their bifurcations. Applications of this theory to nonautonomous and stochastically forced systems are a very active field of climate research. The empirical evidence that abrupt transitions have indeed occurred in the past stems exclusively from paleoclimate proxy records. In this review, we explain the basic theory needed to describe critical transitions, summarize the proxy evidence for past abrupt climate transitions in different parts of the Earth system, and examine some candidates for future abrupt transitions in response to ongoing anthropogenic forcing. Predicting such transitions remains difficult and is subject to large uncertainties. Substantial improvements in our understanding of the nonlinear mechanisms underlying abrupt transitions of Earth system components are needed. We argue that such an improved understanding requires combining insights from (a) paleoclimatic records; (b) simulations using a hierarchy of models, from conceptual to comprehensive ones; and (c) time series analysis of recent observation-based data that encode the dynamics of the present-day Earth system components that are potentially prone to tipping.},

The goal is then to identify, date, characterize, and rank past critical transitions in terms of importance, thus possibly yielding a more thorough perspective on climatic history. To illustrate such an approach, which is inspired by the punctuated equilibrium perspective on the theory of evolution, we have analyzed 2 key high-resolution datasets: the CENOGRID marine compilation (past 66 Myr), and North Atlantic U1308 record (past 3.3 Myr). By combining recurrence analysis of the individual time series with a multivariate representation of the system based on the theory of the quasi-potential, we identify the key abrupt transitions associated with major regime changes that separate various clusters of climate variability. This allows interpreting the time-evolution of the system as a trajectory taking place in a dynamical landscape, whose multiscale features describe a hierarchy of metastable states and associated tipping points.},

Doing so led to fundamentally new ways to study the response of climate models to perturbations, and to perform detection and attribution for climate change signals. Hasselmann’s programme has been extremely influential in climate science and beyond. In this Perspective, we first summarize the main aspects of such a programme using modern concepts and tools of statistical physics and applied mathematics. We then provide an overview of some promising scientific perspectives that might clarify the science behind the climate crisis and that stem from Hasselmann’s ideas. We show how to perform rigorous and data-driven model reduction by constructing parameterizations in systems that do not necessarily feature a timescale separation between unresolved and resolved processes. We outline a general theoretical framework for explaining the relationship between climate variability and climate change, and for performing climate change projections. This framework enables us seamlessly to explain some key general aspects of climatic tipping points.

Two types of noise are studied: environmental (Gaussian white) noise and state-dependent demographic noise. The dynamical mechanism responsible for both phenomena is a transition from one stable steady state to another driven by stochastic forcing, mediated by an unstable steady state. Exploiting a generic and effective two-dimensional reduced model for real-world mutualistic networks, we find that the average transient lifetime scales algebraically with the noise amplitude, for both environmental and demographic noise. We develop a physical understanding of the scaling laws through an analysis of the mean first passage time from one steady state to another.

In this linear model the population size at any time is a reflection of many historical effects. The intrinsic rate of increase, r, is a measure of the responsiveness of the population to changes in k. A responsive population (r ≈ 1) does not retain historical effects for long, whereas a sluggish population (r ≈ 0) does. 3. The variance of the population size through time always increases with r. But the presence of much predictability in the environment, as measured by the serial correlation between consecutive values of K, reduces the influence of r. High serial correlation allows time for even a sluggish population to achieve an N near the current K thereby causing the population variance to nearly equal the carrying-capacity variance. 4. The predictability of the population size is in general a reflection of both its responsiveness to changes in K and the predictability of K itself. However if the population is perfectly responsive (r = 1), then its predictability becomes a direct expression of the predictability of K. Conversely, if K is unpredictable then the predictability of the population depends solely on its own responsiveness. Except in these special cases, the population's predictability depends on both factors. 5. The temporal pattern of the population size depends on the population's responsiveness and on the temporal pattern of the carrying capacity. If r {\textless} 1 then the population pattern preferentially represents the long-term components present within the carrying-capacity pattern, if r = 1 no component is preferentially represented, and if r {\textgreater} 1 the short-term components are preferentially represented. The population's temporal pattern is "connected" to the carrying-capacity's temporal pattern through a "filter" whose frequency characteristics are set by r. 6. The linear model and logistic model were compared through computer simulation. In the logistic, but not the linear, model deviations of N above K are restored more strongly than deviations of N below K. As a result the population size from the logistic model was invariably slightly lower than in the linear model, and the logistic population variance was slightly higher. 7. The predictions about the serial correlation between consecutive population sizes which were derived analytically from the linear model were checked with computer simulations on the logistic model. When the coefficient of variation (CV) of K was 5\%, the differences between the models were not detectable with even 1,000 census points. When the CV was 15\%, provided population extinction did not occur, the differences again were not detectable with 1,000 points. 8. Population extinction due to a fluctuating K is shown to be related to two issues: the change in K may be translated into a perturbation to N and the perturbation to N may be restored. The responsiveness of the population is the parameter relevant to the first issue and the rate of return to equilibrium following a perturbation is the parameter relating to the second.},

	abstract = {The relation between the dynamics of population models in which all the environmental parameters are strictly deterministic and the corresponding more realistic models with random environmental fluctuations are considered. The connection between the deterministic, mechanical usage of the term "stability" and that usage which associates stability or instability with the degree of random population fluctuation in a stochastic environment is discussed. The eigenvalues of the (deterministic or average) "interaction matrix" or "community matrix" play a key role in both circumstances. In the deterministic environment, only the signs of the real parts of these eigenvalues are needed to know whether the population interactions are stabilizing. In the stochastic environment, where the system may be in tension between the stabilizing population interactions and the destabilizing environmental fluctuations, the magnitudes of the real parts of these eigenvalues must be contrasted with the magnitudes of the characteristic environmental variances. These points are developed in a general way and are illustrated by specific analytic and numerical work on single-species and multispecies models. Some applications of the theory are indicated, both to circumstances where it may be used to justify deterministic calculations and to the opposite extreme circumstances where even the smallest environmental stochasticity leads to a result qualitatively different from the deterministic one.},

	abstract = {Recent experiments have probed the relative likelihoods of trajectories in stochastic systems by observing survival probabilities within a tube of radius \$R\$ in spacetime. We measure such probabilities here for a colloidal particle in a corrugated channel, corresponding to a bistable potential with state-dependent diffusivity. In contrast to previous findings for state-independent noise, we find that the most probable pathway changes qualitatively as the tube radius \$R\$ is altered. We explain this by computing the survival probabilities predicted by overdamped Langevin dynamics. At high enough resolution (small enough \$R\$), survival probabilities depend solely on diffusivity variations, independent of deterministic forces; finite \$R\$ corrections yield a generalization of the Onsager-Machlup action. As corollary, ratios of survival probabilities are singular as \$R {\textbackslash}to 0\$, but become regular, and described by the classical Onsager-Machlup action, only in the special case of state-independent noise.},

	abstract = {The sojourn probability of an It{\textbackslash}{\textasciicircum}o diffusion process, i.e. its probability to remain in the tubular neighborhood of a smooth path, is a central quantity in the study of path probabilities. For \$N\$-dimensional It{\textbackslash}{\textasciicircum}o processes with state-dependent full-rank diffusion tensor, we derive a general expression for the sojourn probability in tubes whose radii are small but finite, and fixed by the metric of the ambient Euclidean space. The central quantity in our study is the exit rate at which trajectories leave the tube for the first time. This has an interpretation as a Lagrangian and can be measured directly in experiment, unlike previously defined sojourn probabilities which depend on prior knowledge of the state-dependent diffusivity. We find that while in the limit of vanishing tube radius the ratio of sojourn probabilities for a pair of distinct paths is in general divergent, the same for a path and its time-reversal is always convergent and finite. This provides a pathwise definition of irreversibility for It{\textbackslash}{\textasciicircum}o processes that is agnostic to the state-dependence of the diffusivity. For one-dimensional systems we derive an explicit expression for our Lagrangian in terms of the drift and diffusivity, and find that our result differs from previously reported multiplicative-noise Lagrangians. We confirm our result by comparing to numerical simulations, and relate our theory to the Stratonovich Lagrangian for multiplicative noise. For one-dimensional systems, we discuss under which conditions the vanishing-radius limiting ratio of sojourn probabilities for a pair of forward and backward paths recovers the established pathwise entropy production. Finally, we demonstrate for our one-dimensional example system that the most probable tube for a barrier crossing depends sensitively on the tube radius, and hence on the tolerated amount of fluctuations around the smooth reference path.},
